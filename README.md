# Video Editor

Video Editor is a small browser-based prototype that experiments with different layouts and controls for editing or previewing video using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Multiple interface iterations across `video editor 0.html` – `video editor 5.html`.
- Basic video playback controls (play, pause, scrub) in the browser.
- Simple, framework-free implementation using vanilla web technologies.

## Project structure

- `video editor 0.html` – First version of the editor UI.
- `video editor 1.html` – Refined layout and controls.
- `video editor 2.html` – Additional tweaks or interaction changes.
- `video editor 3.html` – Further iteration of the editor design.
- `video editor 4.html` – Alternative layout or behavior.
- `video editor 5.html` – Latest prototype of the editor.
- `LICENSE` – MIT license for this project.
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage instructions.

## Usage

- Load the desired HTML file in your browser.
- Use the provided controls to:
- Play and pause the sample video.
- Scrub through the timeline if a seek bar is available.
- Interact with any experimental buttons or sliders present in that version.

If you encounter issues, make sure:

- The video source path used in the HTML file is correct.
- You are running the files over HTTP if the browser blocks local media access.

## Technologies

- **HTML5** for structure and `<video>` element.
- **CSS3** for layout and styling.
- **JavaScript** (vanilla) for player controls and any editing logic.

## Roadmap

Potential future improvements:

- Timeline with selectable in/out points.
- Basic trimming and export of clips.
- Keyboard shortcuts for precise navigation.
- Dark/light theme toggle for the editor UI.
